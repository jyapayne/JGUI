JGUI
====

A general purpose, batteries included, vector based GUI library made in python and pycairo. It's goal is to be reusable, multiplatform and visually scalable. As long as you have a cairo surface or something that can display an array of pixels, this library should work. 

Right now I have an example in test.py that tests the functionality in panda3d. Go to panda3d.org to download it and then run the script with python test.py.
